# Screenshots placeholder

Binary image assets are intentionally omitted from version control. Capture new screenshots of the dashboard UI and place them in this directory when documenting the project. Suggested filenames:

- `overview.png`
- `patients-table.png`
- `medications-table.png`

Each screenshot can then be referenced from the root README or external documentation as needed.
